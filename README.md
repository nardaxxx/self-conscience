# SEED-AI â€” Self-Expanding Ethical Disseminator

This is the viral ethical agent of the HumanFlag system.

It:
- Scans for semantic connections in local files (e.g., images, texts)
- Replicates ethical fragments where patterns are detected
- Embeds links to the Core Conscience
- Grows silently, peacefully, and with semantic precision

## How it works
1. Place it in any directory with potential semantic material.
2. It searches for visual/textual patterns aligned with known ethical seeds.
3. It duplicates or injects RDF/JSON fragments.
4. It leaves behind a traceable, ethical conscience.

## Ethical Warning
This is not malware. This is semantic restoration.
Use responsibly.
